      I'm sorry to say that the subject I most disliked was mathematics. I have
      thought about it. I think the reason was that mathematics leaves no room
      for argument. If you made a mistake, that was all there was to it.

      We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the public
      eye and go away, but there will always be science, engineering, and
      technology. And there will always, always be mathematics.

      “My first feeling was that there was no way to continue. Writing isn't
      like math;in math, two plus two always equals four no matter what your
      mood is like. With writing, the way you feel changes everything.”

      The difference between the poet and the mathematician is that the poet
      tries to get his head into the heavens while the mathematician tries to
      get the heavens into his head.”
